        "I just got back into my dorm room after doing some studying in the Sobrato computer lab with my boyfriend. Even though it is kind of late I didn\u2019t feel very tired at all. Rather, I was quite awake and planning to complete some more tasks before heading to bed. I just finished snacking on some nachos in the computer lab, and yet I was still a bit hungry when I got to my dorm room. And so, I ate a few peanut M&Ms and fixed myself a bagel with grape jam. I was basically pretty relaxed too, because tomorrow I only have class and lecture and choir rehearsal (no quizzes or exams). Physically, I felt ok but a bit gross too because I feel I had put on a few pounds this quarter. Psychologically, I felt calm and happy in general\u2026I had a relaxing night of just doing some reading for my psychology class, attending the Loyola Tuesday night liturgy for fun for the first time, and had a warm hug and goodbye from my boyfriend when he dropped me off at my suite front door. I was sitting here in my room, not much in my mind, actually (rare for me J), besides what I ought to do next. It is warm in here and the night is peaceful.  index: 0\n",

        "I was sitting in the computer lab upstairs in Benson, reading my chapter for my PSYC 1 class. I remember wondering if I read very slow, because it seems like it takes a long time for me to get through one page. I wondered if it took other people (people in my class or in this college) the same amount of time to do so. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s boring or tedious reading, though\u2026I\u2019m actually very interested in the subject matter. In fact, I would probably read anything psychology in my own time. I thought about a lot of things\u2026I guess a lot of things go through my mind at times. Whenever I enjoy psychology (a recurring thought in my mind is whether or not I should go to graduate school for psychology or go to law school. I\u2019ve been so uncertain about whether I ought to pursue the study of law for a long time now, even since the idea got implanted into me my freshmen year. I know I can be successful as a lawyer, but I\u2019m just not sure if I would be happy. I always find myself in some debate over pride and honor and happiness and passion. I know I can synthesize the two, but for some reason, I still view my life situation as one or the other. Going into law would be the more practical path, because I really really need the larger salary (I will be in great debt after graduation) but I really have no significant interest in law. While reading, I also thought about how fast my interests can change as well, and how I can basically will myself to enjoy law. I mean, once I see some purpose to doing something, I do enjoy it more, or have more motivation towards it. So yeah, a lot of things were going through my mind as I read. I\u2019m not easily distracted but I do find myself having instances where it\u2019s difficult to concentrate. People are coming in and out of the room, and my sick boyfriend coughs every once in a while next to me. He is also a factor in my decision (about law/ graduate school). Every day, in the back of my mind, I worry about what\u2019s going to happen to us. He\u2019s graduating this year and we\u2019re not sure where he\u2019s going to go to law school yet. I want to be near him, but at the same time, I want to independently make decisions on my own self interest. Oh yeah, and physically, I feel very well rested (I got about 9.5 hours of sleep! The most I\u2019ve gotten for\u2026perhaps the past few months!) I\u2019m warm too, and comfortable in my sweats and sneakers. I feel a little self-conscious, though, because I feel like my curly hair is unruly at times and I want to lose a few pounds on my body. Other than that, I feel fine, and am just hoping that I won\u2019t be sick (again) soon! I also was chewing some Orbitz gum, which tastes pretty good J I wasn\u2019t moving very much\u2026just reading, and occasionally shifting how I sat. I wished the chairs up in Benson were more comfortable and less slanted though.  index: 1\n",

        "Before the alarm went off, I was on Facebook looking at people\u2019s profiles for whom I am writing a recommendation. I was pleasantly surprised by one of the girls and by how she presented herself on Facebook. I was having a mixture of feelings \u2013 none of them particularly strong. However, I was feeling slightly anxious because I have to fill out these recommendations for girls I don\u2019t know especially well. I still want to give them a good, accurate eval, but this is harder and more time consuming without knowing them very well. I was also feeling a slight amount of self-imposed pressure and stress as I think about all of the work I need tostart tonight. I keep putting it off for other tasks I need to get done, so my mountains of reading just keep looming I the back of my mind. Despite these slightly anxious feelings however, I also felt comfortable. It\u2019s the weekend now and I\u2019m sitting in my room with nice, relaxing lighting. I felt a slight, fresh breeze coming through my open window, but was also vaguely aware of my warm hoody. I was chewing a piece of mint gum that tasted refreshing. Towards the end of my 15 minutes, I was checking my email. I felt excited and curious as I was logging onto GroupWise, because I never know what new, fun email I may have. The email reminded me of an assignment I have for my storytelling class, and another \u201cto-do\u201d item was added to my mental checklist along with just a small twinge of stress. Throughout this 15 minutes, I was listening to Phoebe Snow on my iPod, making me feel good with her upbeat style.  index: 2\n",

I was angry about having to deal with all of the stuff and I was telling my roommate about the meeting I had just had about it all. I was totally venting to her and I could tell she wasn\u2019t really listening because she was busy with homework. I sat back and threw the papers on the floor and then just sat there for like 5 minutes. I felt really sad, but I felt really foolish for getting upset over such a trivial issue.

One of the other guys in the room got up from his seat and proclaimed he was going to sleep and made some awkward comment as he left. We remarked on how he has little social tact and always makes the girls on our hall feel awkward. I saw two girls I know outside, heading back to their dorm. Some of the people in the room yell at the two girls far below. They cannot see who is yelling which is good because someone was screaming obscenities. We disbanded to our separate rooms while I absentmindedly watched Chronicles of Roddick and checked facebook. Thought about the work I had to do in the coming week.

She said that she has a ton of work to do but that she just wanted to call me to say hi and that she loves me\u2026we\u2019ll talk later. I was very aware of the abundance of noise from the construction workers. I also noticed that it is a pretty gloomy day. Once I made it back to my room, I cleaned up a few things that were on my desk. Then my roommate came in the room, asked how my final went and I told him it went really well. He looked really tired and it made me laugh. As I was about to start this, I thought about how much better my mood is today and that even though I got way less sleep, I am happier. I began to space out about how that has to do with my performance on my exam and a lot less stressors for the near future.  index: 19\n",

Scared for one of the characters as her mother-in-law was trying to kill her of set it up to look like a suicide. The end of the episode was a good one because everything that was misunderstood was cleared up and now everything seems to be okay. Nevertheless, it left me anxious to know that something else inevitably will happen. It was a very good suspenseful episode."

The point he goes on to saying is a piece of advice: that you should find someone who doesn\u2019t look at how you look, that cares about the person you are. The faces of my friend and my boyfriend were distinct and pretty clear.

        "I was in modern day Jerusalem, but I can remember thinking how the landscape looked more like Ireland to me. The dream started off in either my aunt\u2019s or my grandma\u2019s house. We were getting ready to go on a trip and there were a couple suitcases open in the large bathroom. I vaguely remember something about the power going out for a little while\u2026I recall wanting to pack up and get on out trip but not being too agitated either. At one point, things were just slow to get going and my aunt playfully ran into the large bathroom where the suitcases were \u2013 there was someone else sitting in there. Auntie sat next to them on the ground and I looked over at the jeans she was wearing. I thought to myself how weird it was that she had cut the length off of the back of them so the leg wouldn\u2019t drag on the ground but had left the front the same length. Auntie had previously stepped on the scale and it registered something like 70 kilograms. I ran over to the scale and it registered something like 80 kilos. I was trying to convert that over to pounds and she asked me what the scale said. Even though it had registered as more than her, I was quite carefree about the whole thing and told her and I think she helped me figure it out. Sometime after this we were on our trip and in a small, charming western town. There was a fairly large group of us, but I can only identify my friend Rochelle as being with us. We went into the restaurant that was well lit, had a couple walls missing so the breeze from the outside circulated through (it was a beautiful, sunny day) and the benches and tables were made of sturdy wood. For some reason, not everyone in our group was there and so we were ordering in spurts. Rochelle was one of the first to order. Her order came about an hour later \u2013 waffles, some type of meat, and two delicious looking poached eggs. But I remember thinking that with a wait time like that, it would take about an hour and a half for everyone to get their food! I was both amused and irritated by this. Then, somehow, we ended up in this castle-like structure in Jerusalem. I was with a couple other people, but I can only distinctly remember my grandma commenting on how King David, who had lived in this castle, had been this horrible tyrant and was spurting off some narrative about him. This didn\u2019t seem quite right to me. As I looked out one of the castle\u2019s windows onto the landscape of the green city, I remembered that King David had been a \u201cman after God\u2019s own heart.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe that Lolita was so grossly mistaken and tried to go and say something to argue with her, but she brushed me off and went down the castle steps.  index: 1\n",

Then next thing I know I\u2019m with my dad and I have to drive to school. My grandma was there and had brought a brand new Prius but wouldn\u2019t let me drive it, so I drove my car. Then at school (I\u2019m back at my old high school) the teacher is talking to the kids about drinking and everyone leaves class and goes to the Spanish teacher who has donuts in her room. Everyone is sitting down copying answers when the 1st teacher comes in and offers muffins. The Spanish teacher is the only one who wanted a muffin.  index: 74\n",

        "I was in the living room of a friend house. We were all watching TV when another friend of mine called my name from the elevator in the hall. I walked over and she asked me if I could get her any marijuana. I said no, and as she asked, two kids and their mom walked by, it made me nervous. I got on the elevator and we went up. I stepped out and found myself in the bathroom, ready for a shower. All the showers were occupied by fats girls I was frustrated because I anted to have sex, but all these girls were ugly. I finally got a shower and once I got in my girlfriend showed up. We got naked but didn\u2019t have sex. After this I went up to a friend room. She gave me a beer called \u201cChicago Bull Beer\u2019. A friend remarked that it was tasty and citrusy. I couldn\u2019t taste citrus, but it was good. We drank with the door open, which made me think we could get written up and in turn made me nervous.  index: 141\n",

        "The first thing I remember is being at the Cal Train Station. I remember waiting forever I get on the train. I remember thinking that I was feeling anxious and just wanted to be on the train. I was in so much of a rush I was telling people to hurry up but I also forgot something myself when I got on the train. After taking the Cal Train, my family and I rented a car. I clearly remember that all the roads we drove on were heading south. At one time we had to make a u-turn because it was a one way street. At this point I know I talked to my brother and sister about something but I forget. The next dream sequence landed the car driving through Malibu and Pepperdine University. I commented to my dad I\u2019m glad to chose Santa Clara over Pepperdine. As we were driving I remember looking out the window at all the nice houses in the area and wishing I could live in a house like that. As we were driving we came to what was supposed to be UCLA. I told my mom that she wouldn\u2019t be able to convince me to change schools. This UCLS, however, was like a waterpark. It was early morning and there were little kids running around with a lot of Disney costume people. I remember asking myself where all the students, but remembering it was early and most students sleep in. The final thing in my dream was a girl from my high school, Christina Murrillo, walking by with her friends. I said hi to her and thought that her friends were very pretty.

        "All I can recall right now is me being with my older brother. The last words I said to him before waking up dealt with me commenting on how he had my dream job. We were standing alone before I work up (I think our mom was present sometime in the dream too though, (unknown)). A few minutes before I woke up though, there were other people in my dream/ in the scene too. These people were strangers to me but friends to my brother. My brother worked in his residency. The people were co-workers/ fellow students doing residency w/ my brother, and they seemed very friendly and outgoing and said a few things. There were a only few of them (2-3?), and one of them was a caucasian girl. My brother was cooking/ preparing this huge oven pan or dish of fried rice. The fried rice had texture and was somewhat colorful (the yellow/brown of the rice, and with some orange from some of the scattered carrots and some green from some of the scattered peas. I remember feeling hungry looking at the rice J and my brother smushing it and stirring it with some kind of spoon or spatula. He told me it was his turn to do what he was doing (prepare the rice or food). I remember feeling a bit jealous of his job or whatever he was doing I think. He also seemed somewhat distanced and doing his own thing \u2013 not necessarily ignoring me but being the big brother who was in a different stage in life than me. I believe I felt like a little kid too, and like we were in a somewhat unfamiliar place for some reason (the closest description I can come up with is that it\u2019s like one of those parking garages?)  index: 183\n",
