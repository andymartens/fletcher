List of emotion words used in dream analysis.

It's not a perfect list, and there is no perfect list. It could be bigger and
more complete. It could be much more narrow. But it seemed like a reasonable
list to start with.

I attempted to include all the basic variations of each root word. For example,
adore, adored, and adoring are all variations on the same root word. When
counting the number of dreams that contain these words, however, I grouped these
variations together. If one dream contains the word "adore" and another dream 
contains the word "adored," the results would show that two dreams contained the
word "adored."

I omitted emotion-realted words that have common meaning unrelated to emotion.
For example, "sunny" can be used to refer to a person's emotional state, but
it was omitted from this list because it's at least as likely to used in a way
that is unrelated to emotion.
