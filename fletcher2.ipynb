        "I just got back into my dorm room after doing some studying in the Sobrato computer lab with my boyfriend. Even though it is kind of late I didn\u2019t feel very tired at all. Rather, I was quite awake and planning to complete some more tasks before heading to bed. I just finished snacking on some nachos in the computer lab, and yet I was still a bit hungry when I got to my dorm room. And so, I ate a few peanut M&Ms and fixed myself a bagel with grape jam. I was basically pretty relaxed too, because tomorrow I only have class and lecture and choir rehearsal (no quizzes or exams). Physically, I felt ok but a bit gross too because I feel I had put on a few pounds this quarter. Psychologically, I felt calm and happy in general\u2026I had a relaxing night of just doing some reading for my psychology class, attending the Loyola Tuesday night liturgy for fun for the first time, and had a warm hug and goodbye from my boyfriend when he dropped me off at my suite front door. I was sitting here in my room, not much in my mind, actually (rare for me J), besides what I ought to do next. It is warm in here and the night is peaceful.  index: 0\n",

        "I was sitting in the computer lab upstairs in Benson, reading my chapter for my PSYC 1 class. I remember wondering if I read very slow, because it seems like it takes a long time for me to get through one page. I wondered if it took other people (people in my class or in this college) the same amount of time to do so. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s boring or tedious reading, though\u2026I\u2019m actually very interested in the subject matter. In fact, I would probably read anything psychology in my own time. I thought about a lot of things\u2026I guess a lot of things go through my mind at times. Whenever I enjoy psychology (a recurring thought in my mind is whether or not I should go to graduate school for psychology or go to law school. I\u2019ve been so uncertain about whether I ought to pursue the study of law for a long time now, even since the idea got implanted into me my freshmen year. I know I can be successful as a lawyer, but I\u2019m just not sure if I would be happy. I always find myself in some debate over pride and honor and happiness and passion. I know I can synthesize the two, but for some reason, I still view my life situation as one or the other. Going into law would be the more practical path, because I really really need the larger salary (I will be in great debt after graduation) but I really have no significant interest in law. While reading, I also thought about how fast my interests can change as well, and how I can basically will myself to enjoy law. I mean, once I see some purpose to doing something, I do enjoy it more, or have more motivation towards it. So yeah, a lot of things were going through my mind as I read. I\u2019m not easily distracted but I do find myself having instances where it\u2019s difficult to concentrate. People are coming in and out of the room, and my sick boyfriend coughs every once in a while next to me. He is also a factor in my decision (about law/ graduate school). Every day, in the back of my mind, I worry about what\u2019s going to happen to us. He\u2019s graduating this year and we\u2019re not sure where he\u2019s going to go to law school yet. I want to be near him, but at the same time, I want to independently make decisions on my own self interest. Oh yeah, and physically, I feel very well rested (I got about 9.5 hours of sleep! The most I\u2019ve gotten for\u2026perhaps the past few months!) I\u2019m warm too, and comfortable in my sweats and sneakers. I feel a little self-conscious, though, because I feel like my curly hair is unruly at times and I want to lose a few pounds on my body. Other than that, I feel fine, and am just hoping that I won\u2019t be sick (again) soon! I also was chewing some Orbitz gum, which tastes pretty good J I wasn\u2019t moving very much\u2026just reading, and occasionally shifting how I sat. I wished the chairs up in Benson were more comfortable and less slanted though.  index: 1\n",

        "Before the alarm went off, I was on Facebook looking at people\u2019s profiles for whom I am writing a recommendation. I was pleasantly surprised by one of the girls and by how she presented herself on Facebook. I was having a mixture of feelings \u2013 none of them particularly strong. However, I was feeling slightly anxious because I have to fill out these recommendations for girls I don\u2019t know especially well. I still want to give them a good, accurate eval, but this is harder and more time consuming without knowing them very well. I was also feeling a slight amount of self-imposed pressure and stress as I think about all of the work I need tostart tonight. I keep putting it off for other tasks I need to get done, so my mountains of reading just keep looming I the back of my mind. Despite these slightly anxious feelings however, I also felt comfortable. It\u2019s the weekend now and I\u2019m sitting in my room with nice, relaxing lighting. I felt a slight, fresh breeze coming through my open window, but was also vaguely aware of my warm hoody. I was chewing a piece of mint gum that tasted refreshing. Towards the end of my 15 minutes, I was checking my email. I felt excited and curious as I was logging onto GroupWise, because I never know what new, fun email I may have. The email reminded me of an assignment I have for my storytelling class, and another \u201cto-do\u201d item was added to my mental checklist along with just a small twinge of stress. Throughout this 15 minutes, I was listening to Phoebe Snow on my iPod, making me feel good with her upbeat style.  index: 2\n",

        "I was sitting on my bed, leaning against the wall, relaxed but not lying down and not really sleepy. I felt really frustrated because I was looking through some scholarship paperwork. I was angry about having to deal with all of the stuff and I was telling my roommate about the meeting I had just had about it all. I was totally venting to her and I could tell she wasn\u2019t really listening because she was busy with homework. I sat back and threw the papers on the floor and then just sat there for like 5 minutes. I felt really sad, but I felt really foolish for getting upset over such a trivial issue. My body felt super comfortable, but I was thinking about all that stuff.  index: 10\n",

One of the other guys in the room got up from his seat and proclaimed he was going to sleep and made some awkward comment as he left. We remarked on how he has little social tact and always makes the girls on our hall feel awkward. I saw two girls I know outside, heading back to their dorm. Some of the people in the room yell at the two girls far below. They cannot see who is yelling which is good because someone was screaming obscenities. We disbanded to our separate rooms while I absentmindedly watched Chronicles of Roddick and checked facebook. Thought about the work I had to do in the coming week. A little stressed but still want a lazy Sunday.  index: 17\n",

        "I just finished a final that I had been cramming all night for. I feel really good because the test went well and the work paid off. As I was walking back to my room, my girlfriend called me and I told her the test went really well. She said that she has a ton of work to do but that she just wanted to call me to say hi and that she loves me\u2026we\u2019ll talk later. I was very aware of the abundance of noise from the construction workers. I also noticed that it is a pretty gloomy day. Once I made it back to my room, I cleaned up a few things that were on my desk. Then my roommate came in the room, asked how my final went and I told him it went really well. He looked really tired and it made me laugh. As I was about to start this, I thought about how much better my mood is today and that even though I got way less sleep, I am happier. I began to space out about how that has to do with my performance on my exam and a lot less stressors for the near future.  index: 19\n",

This episode was an unusual one for it was jammed pack with happy, scary, and sad events. During this experience I was nervous as the suspense built. Sad when one of the characters died. Scared for one of the characters as her mother-in-law was trying to kill her of set it up to look like a suicide. The end of the episode was a good one because everything that was misunderstood was cleared up and now everything seems to be okay. Nevertheless, it left me anxious to know that something else inevitably will happen. It was a very good suspenseful episode."

        "Wow, right before waking up I was crying in my sleep! I was exclaiming somewhat emotionally to my friend and current suitemate that \u201cEven though you look much different now, you\u2019ve always been beautiful to me.\u201d Before that I said \u201cI know I\u2019m a girl and everything, but you\u2019ve always been beautiful.\u201d I said this to her honestly meaning them and looking into her eyes and holding her two hands. The setting I can\u2019t quite remember now\u2026perhaps a living room environment. I was sitting or lying down to the left of my friend and we were both (unknown) my boyfriend. He was telling her, sincerely and kindly yet was brutally honest that \u201c\u2026I thought you were unattractive,\u201d but (unknown) he saw her another time or at another place, he thought she was attractive. The point he goes on to saying is a piece of advice: that you should find someone who doesn\u2019t look at how you look, that cares about the person you are. The faces of my friend and my boyfriend were distinct and pretty clear. I remember seeing color (normal tones I think not too bright, etc.) and I remember feeling a lot of emotion, and thinking too.  index: 0\n",

        "I was in modern day Jerusalem, but I can remember thinking how the landscape looked more like Ireland to me. The dream started off in either my aunt\u2019s or my grandma\u2019s house. We were getting ready to go on a trip and there were a couple suitcases open in the large bathroom. I vaguely remember something about the power going out for a little while\u2026I recall wanting to pack up and get on out trip but not being too agitated either. At one point, things were just slow to get going and my aunt playfully ran into the large bathroom where the suitcases were \u2013 there was someone else sitting in there. Auntie sat next to them on the ground and I looked over at the jeans she was wearing. I thought to myself how weird it was that she had cut the length off of the back of them so the leg wouldn\u2019t drag on the ground but had left the front the same length. Auntie had previously stepped on the scale and it registered something like 70 kilograms. I ran over to the scale and it registered something like 80 kilos. I was trying to convert that over to pounds and she asked me what the scale said. Even though it had registered as more than her, I was quite carefree about the whole thing and told her and I think she helped me figure it out. Sometime after this we were on our trip and in a small, charming western town. There was a fairly large group of us, but I can only identify my friend Rochelle as being with us. We went into the restaurant that was well lit, had a couple walls missing so the breeze from the outside circulated through (it was a beautiful, sunny day) and the benches and tables were made of sturdy wood. For some reason, not everyone in our group was there and so we were ordering in spurts. Rochelle was one of the first to order. Her order came about an hour later \u2013 waffles, some type of meat, and two delicious looking poached eggs. But I remember thinking that with a wait time like that, it would take about an hour and a half for everyone to get their food! I was both amused and irritated by this. Then, somehow, we ended up in this castle-like structure in Jerusalem. I was with a couple other people, but I can only distinctly remember my grandma commenting on how King David, who had lived in this castle, had been this horrible tyrant and was spurting off some narrative about him. This didn\u2019t seem quite right to me. As I looked out one of the castle\u2019s windows onto the landscape of the green city, I remembered that King David had been a \u201cman after God\u2019s own heart.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe that Lolita was so grossly mistaken and tried to go and say something to argue with her, but she brushed me off and went down the castle steps.  index: 1\n",

Two of my friends began screaming at each other but what they said didn\u2019t make any sense. Everybody was sitting in a room staring at the two of them fight. While everyone was watching, I walked out of the room and was outside on the street. It was night and there was nobody on the street.

I started to walk really really fast because I had an extreme urge to poop when all of a sudden a tall blonde guy who seemed to be a fellow freshmen challenged me to a contest. The contest was like \u201cyour momma\u201d from MTV but it turned out to be a rapping contest about yourself. I felt nervous because I definitely can\u2019t rap and didn\u2019t know what I was going to rap about. I started coming up with lines in my head about owning 2 Ferraris and a motorcycle. As I was thinking about the lines I realized that I still had to go diarrhea really bad. But right then, the tall blonde guy cam up to me with a written description of the contest and I looked over it. By this point a large group of people had circled around us and I definitely couldn\u2019t go back on the contest but I was really nervous about whether or not I would be able to come up with funny lines and I really had to poo!  index: 16\n",

I stepped out and found myself in the bathroom, ready for a shower. All the showers were occupied by fats girls I was frustrated because I anted to have sex, but all these girls were ugly. I finally got a shower and once I got in my girlfriend showed up. We got naked but didn\u2019t have sex. After this I went up to a friend room.

I remember thinking that I was feeling anxious and just wanted to be on the train. I was in so much of a rush I was telling people to hurry up but I also forgot something myself when I got on the train. After taking the Cal Train, my family and I rented a car. I clearly remember that all the roads we drove on were heading south. At one time we had to make a u-turn because it was a one way street. At this point I know I talked to my brother and sister about something but I forget. The next dream sequence landed the car driving through Malibu and Pepperdine University. I commented to my dad I\u2019m glad to chose Santa Clara over Pepperdine. As we were driving I remember looking out the window at all the nice houses in the area and wishing I could live in a house like that. As we were driving we came to what was supposed to be UCLA. I told my mom that she wouldn\u2019t be able to convince me to change schools. This UCLS, however, was like a waterpark. It was early morning and there were little kids running around with a lot of Disney costume people. I remember asking myself where all the students, but remembering it was early and most students sleep in. The final thing in my dream was a girl from my high school, Christina Murrillo, walking by with her friends. I said hi to her and thought that her friends were very pretty.

We were standing alone before I work up (I think our mom was present sometime in the dream too though, (unknown)). A few minutes before I woke up though, there were other people in my dream/ in the scene too. These people were strangers to me but friends to my brother. My brother worked in his residency. The people were co-workers/ fellow students doing residency w/ my brother, and they seemed very friendly and outgoing and said a few things. There were a only few of them (2-3?), and one of them was a caucasian girl. My brother was cooking/ preparing this huge oven pan or dish of fried rice. The fried rice had texture and was somewhat colorful (the yellow/brown of the rice, and with some orange from some of the scattered carrots and some green from some of the scattered peas. I remember feeling hungry looking at the rice J and my brother smushing it and stirring it with some kind of spoon or spatula. He told me it was his turn to do what he was doing (prepare the rice or food). I remember feeling a bit jealous of his job or whatever he was doing I think. He also seemed somewhat distanced and doing his own thing \u2013 not necessarily ignoring me but being the big brother who was in a different stage in life than me. I believe I felt like a little kid too, and like we were in a somewhat unfamiliar place for some reason (the closest description I can come up with is that it\u2019s like one of those parking garages?)  index: 183\n",

        "Cluster 2. Representative dream:  I was at some kind of gather of family and friends and I knew there was a baby around that I wanted to hold. But the mom needed the baby\u2019s things like a dollhouse and stroller so a couple of my friends and I went down an elevator to the lower levels of the building and retrieved those items and shopped a little. I felt like I had been in that shop many times before and I was in the aisle that I was always in when I went in so I didn\u2019t get anything. I went ahead of my two friends and I got to hold the baby. I don\u2019t know the mother of the baby, but the baby knew me and I don\u2019t know the gender. I thought maybe a boy. I tried keeping his head up but it was all squashed and deformed. But then when I help him up over my shoulder, his neck and head were okay. When I help him up in front of me where I could see his front, he was deformed at the neck and head and he talked to me like an older child would. My two friends came back after a while and one had definitely showered. My family and I, some friends, and Jennifer Lopez were at some kind of sports event. I had watched this type of rugby-ish game before. It had little girls and boys and older ones too. There was even a girl from Santa Clara. I think I was talking to this kid who I knew (an older version of the baby earlier, but a girl) about the game. The teams were the Yeses and the No\u2019s and I told her that she was a Maybe or that someone else was a Maybe. I had played the game before or had been there numerous times. I felt nostalgic and wanted to share the old game with her even if it was filled of cliques and was so dramatic. There were girls nearby talking about across the street where there was a school, called Eden. They were raving about how cute the boys over there were and then I remembered I had done and thought the same thing: used binoculars to look at the cute boys. The girl beside me told me about a boy she liked who was playing the game. I think it was called Eiffel ball. And I recalled a time when I had liked a boy too. The game was coed and of different ages and so my crush would inevitably show. I told her he must have gone to college because I couldn\u2019t spot him. I was also in college, but this felt like a high school event. I sat near my parents and the baby sat diagonally behind me with her mom and the mom kept complaining about how J. Lo\u2019s hair was in the way. I saw the mom\u2019s face, but I can\u2019t remember it. I told them to sit next to me but they didn\u2019t want to. J. Lo turned around and smiled. The announcer or some guy with a microphone was going through the crowd and random people would say something, like a quote, into the mic. J. Lo said hers and I thought \u2018that\u2019s so totally J. Lo\u2019, because she had said that quote somewhere else too. I started complaining to my dad that the game looked fake and planned out. He said it\u2019s supposed to be like that and after they\u2019ll start to play for real, the beginning is just dramatic and for show. I think my parents were in a fight but I was in Santa Clara, in my dorm with my friends when I got a phone call from my mom. She said that a family friend has a family member in the hospital who is dying. She said my brother was coming to pick him up and bring him to the airport. I ran out, yelled for my brother and looked for his car, but I couldn\u2019t find him. My SCU family friend lived in Casa so I went over there to be with him until my brother arrived. It didn\u2019t really look like Casa and all the people I saw were from my high school. I knew this because I saw one of my old crushes, but he ignored me, but not in an impolite way, he was just talking to other people. I just needed to find the family friend. As I was about to ask if the boys had seen him, I saw my friend from high school from South Carolina and ran to him. I was no longer looking for the family friend. He then became the one who needed comfort because someone in his family was dying or died. I hugged him when I knelt down in the floor to where he was sitting. He was sweaty, didn\u2019t have his glasses, and had been listening to music.\n",

Then I started going to the store and as I was entering I met a couple of my friends. They walked into the store with me and I remember thinking that I needed to get some books. I then started walking down the aisle and I saw bunch of the plush footballs that I wanted to get. I picked one out and then realized that it might be intended to be a dog toy. Then I remember walking around a bunch of machines that sell little toys. I was looking to set some kind of decorations, possibly for my hands. Some of the machines were difficult to reach. I then remember going to eat some food with a couple of my friends. After that I remember being inside of a store with the same friends. One of them, however, kept changing from my friend to another guy that I know. I then started asking that friend if he\u2019s e interested in going to the store that we were already standing in. he said he\u2019d go but that he wanted to get some food first. I laughed at him, along with one of the store employees and told him that we had already gotten some food. But he didn\u2019t eat much, so he wanted to go again. I then remember being in the car with my two friends. I was driving and one of my friends was trying to figure out where to go. One of my friends suggested going somewhere far and taking the freeway, but my other friend told him that I wasn\u2019t a good enough driver to do that. Then I remember that there was some kind of slow slot car like game where the trick shifts below the ground to form a loop like a freeway . I was first looking at it like it was a toy but then the car got transferred. I remember that my friends were saying that the only way the transaction could work was if there was something on the bottom, where the track went. I then remember being transported to watching a movie with my grandma. The movie was about the Sand Pearl Jam and his grandma wanted to know where a certain song occurred. She then said that she likes my band\u2019s music here. I told her that silly because Pearl Jam is considered one of the biggest bands in America\n",

        "Cluster 3. Representative dream:  I was in modern day Jerusalem, but I can remember thinking how the landscape looked more like Ireland to me. The dream started off in either my aunt\u2019s or my grandma\u2019s house. We were getting ready to go on a trip and there were a couple suitcases open in the large bathroom. I vaguely remember something about the power going out for a little while\u2026I recall wanting to pack up and get on out trip but not being too agitated either. At one point, things were just slow to get going and my aunt playfully ran into the large bathroom where the suitcases were \u2013 there was someone else sitting in there. Auntie sat next to them on the ground and I looked over at the jeans she was wearing. I thought to myself how weird it was that she had cut the length off of the back of them so the leg wouldn\u2019t drag on the ground but had left the front the same length. Auntie had previously stepped on the scale and it registered something like 70 kilograms. I ran over to the scale and it registered something like 80 kilos. I was trying to convert that over to pounds and she asked me what the scale said. Even though it had registered as more than her, I was quite carefree about the whole thing and told her and I think she helped me figure it out. Sometime after this we were on our trip and in a small, charming western town. There was a fairly large group of us, but I can only identify my friend Rochelle as being with us. We went into the restaurant that was well lit, had a couple walls missing so the breeze from the outside circulated through (it was a beautiful, sunny day) and the benches and tables were made of sturdy wood. For some reason, not everyone in our group was there and so we were ordering in spurts. Rochelle was one of the first to order. Her order came about an hour later \u2013 waffles, some type of meat, and two delicious looking poached eggs. But I remember thinking that with a wait time like that, it would take about an hour and a half for everyone to get their food! I was both amused and irritated by this. Then, somehow, we ended up in this castle-like structure in Jerusalem. I was with a couple other people, but I can only distinctly remember my grandma commenting on how King David, who had lived in this castle, had been this horrible tyrant and was spurting off some narrative about him. This didn\u2019t seem quite right to me. As I looked out one of the castle\u2019s windows onto the landscape of the green city, I remembered that King David had been a \u201cman after God\u2019s own heart.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe that Lolita was so grossly mistaken and tried to go and say something to argue with her, but she brushed me off and went down the castle steps.\n",

        "Cluster 4. Representative dream:  I was at some kind of gather of family and friends and I knew there was a baby around that I wanted to hold. But the mom needed the baby\u2019s things like a dollhouse and stroller so a couple of my friends and I went down an elevator to the lower levels of the building and retrieved those items and shopped a little. I felt like I had been in that shop many times before and I was in the aisle that I was always in when I went in so I didn\u2019t get anything. I went ahead of my two friends and I got to hold the baby. I don\u2019t know the mother of the baby, but the baby knew me and I don\u2019t know the gender. I thought maybe a boy. I tried keeping his head up but it was all squashed and deformed. But then when I help him up over my shoulder, his neck and head were okay. When I help him up in front of me where I could see his front, he was deformed at the neck and head and he talked to me like an older child would. My two friends came back after a while and one had definitely showered. My family and I, some friends, and Jennifer Lopez were at some kind of sports event. I had watched this type of rugby-ish game before. It had little girls and boys and older ones too. There was even a girl from Santa Clara. I think I was talking to this kid who I knew (an older version of the baby earlier, but a girl) about the game. The teams were the Yeses and the No\u2019s and I told her that she was a Maybe or that someone else was a Maybe. I had played the game before or had been there numerous times. I felt nostalgic and wanted to share the old game with her even if it was filled of cliques and was so dramatic. There were girls nearby talking about across the street where there was a school, called Eden. They were raving about how cute the boys over there were and then I remembered I had done and thought the same thing: used binoculars to look at the cute boys. The girl beside me told me about a boy she liked who was playing the game. I think it was called Eiffel ball. And I recalled a time when I had liked a boy too. The game was coed and of different ages and so my crush would inevitably show. I told her he must have gone to college because I couldn\u2019t spot him. I was also in college, but this felt like a high school event. I sat near my parents and the baby sat diagonally behind me with her mom and the mom kept complaining about how J. Lo\u2019s hair was in the way. I saw the mom\u2019s face, but I can\u2019t remember it. I told them to sit next to me but they didn\u2019t want to. J. Lo turned around and smiled. The announcer or some guy with a microphone was going through the crowd and random people would say something, like a quote, into the mic. J. Lo said hers and I thought \u2018that\u2019s so totally J. Lo\u2019, because she had said that quote somewhere else too. I started complaining to my dad that the game looked fake and planned out. He said it\u2019s supposed to be like that and after they\u2019ll start to play for real, the beginning is just dramatic and for show. I think my parents were in a fight but I was in Santa Clara, in my dorm with my friends when I got a phone call from my mom. She said that a family friend has a family member in the hospital who is dying. She said my brother was coming to pick him up and bring him to the airport. I ran out, yelled for my brother and looked for his car, but I couldn\u2019t find him. My SCU family friend lived in Casa so I went over there to be with him until my brother arrived. It didn\u2019t really look like Casa and all the people I saw were from my high school. I knew this because I saw one of my old crushes, but he ignored me, but not in an impolite way, he was just talking to other people. I just needed to find the family friend. As I was about to ask if the boys had seen him, I saw my friend from high school from South Carolina and ran to him. I was no longer looking for the family friend. He then became the one who needed comfort because someone in his family was dying or died. I hugged him when I knelt down in the floor to where he was sitting. He was sweaty, didn\u2019t have his glasses, and had been listening to music.\n",

I was running from room to room trying to avoid the people chasing me, eventually I found a room with lots of blue blankets. I covered up with those and shut my eyes. I don't recall anyone ever coming in after me. When I opened my eyes again I was tangled in the blankets. I had to tear them apart in order to run away. As I ran back through the house I saw a lot of people I knew. But I was no longer running from the bad guys. This time I walked down a long corridor and ended up at s BBQ with people I knew in high school. I sat at a table with old friends. They asked me about my ex-boyfriend, Chris. I told them I didn't think about him much except when I saw people with his eyes. When I went to pick up food from the line, Chris was right behind me. We hugged and started chatting and I couldn't help but notice how small his feet were.\n",

        "Cluster 4. Representative dream:  I was in some building on the second floor and there were a bunch of people I knew gathered around tables looking at things. I was going to go to the side of the room, but decided to go by my friend and help her. There weren\u2019t a lot of people around her even though she was right in the center of the set of tables. So I figured, \u2018Perfect, more room, plus I\u2019m in the middle.\u2019 There was an escalator coming up from the first floor and directly facing the middle part of the room where my friend and I were. My back was facing the escalator when I nonchalantly turned around because I heard gunshots and commotion. I looked down and I had been hit with a bullet below my ribs. The hold was bleeding a little, but more looked like a caved in bruise or something. I saw the shooter, and he was my friend and I was totally confused as to why he just rode up the escalator and shot a random round. I just knew that he\u2019d shot randomly and wasn\u2019t aiming for me so I wasn\u2019t mad at all. I was just confused because I was thinking in my head how Andrew was a really good guy, so what was he doing? I also thought what a coincidence it was that no one was congregating near the escalator, but off to the side. My thoughts switched to the thought that I needed to get to a hospital to fix my wound. I wasn\u2019t bleeding externally, but all I could think was that I was hit by a bullet and so at any moment (because I didn\u2019t know what was happening internally) I may just have a seizure or something and die. So all I kept thinking was I needed to get to the hospital! At the hospital, I told some nurse lady that I need to go to surgery ASAP or else I would die. She acknowledged that I was in more critical condition than my friend, who\u2019d gotten hit in the foot, but she wasn\u2019t very urgent. I was mad because I had an inclination I needed to be \u201cfixed\u201d ASAP. All of a sudden my heart started racing and my hands and arms shook like I had a seizure or something. It was momentary, but made me mad because I told the lady, \u201cSee! My body\u2019s randomly doing things!\u201d She had a lackadaisical approach so I left to find a surgeon myself. All I could think though was that I needed to find someone I could trust. This one surgeon told me to fill out a few surveys and questionnaires before he could begin, so he knew what kind of a patient I was. It seemed reasonable, until I realized I\u2019d been filling out surveys for two hours! Then I realized that the guy wasn\u2019t going to help me, but just wanted me to take his surveys. I left the room when he wasn\u2019t looking, thinking I need to find a friend\u2019s dad who\u2019s a surgeon. I can trust my friends\u2019 dads! In the meantime surgeons offered their help, but I said no because I didn\u2019t trust them. Then I finally found one of my friends\u2019 dads. He got right to work giving me that shot to knock you out. I told him I had a hard time sleeping at night so he might to give me extra stuff. I was still unsure of trusting him, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he was related to my friend, plus it was a while since I got hit and I needed to remove the bullet from me. It was only a matter of time before I had another one of those seizure things. The doctor made me clean my forearm with a white antiseptic wipe, and he assured me the stuff would put me to sleep for approximately 8.5 hours. But when he did inject me, I started to get drowsy, but didn\u2019t knock out like he promised. That gave me doubts about him and when he went to get more fluid stuff, all I could think was, \u2018I can\u2019t trust him either! And I told him I don\u2019t fall asleep easily, I have a hard time falling asleep at night. I was right!\u2019\n",

Coming down the onramp I can feel that he is accelerating around the whole ramp and about to lose control. I turn to the back left window and see that the other cars on the highway are going way faster than us, so I turn around and grip my chair and start yelling at him to get control. He starts yelling back but I don\u2019t know what he said. We get on the highway and just go in a diagonal line across the lanes and slam into a wall. Then the car kept moving forward while scraping the wall to the left. A couple hundred feet a head I saw a wall perpendicular to the car that we\u2019d hit head on.

I come up to the bridge and before I can stop I see that the bridge ends half-way across the river and I drive over the edge. All I can think is, as I'm driving over the edge in slow motion into the cold, black water is \"Oh my god I've killed the baby\". I scream in my dream and wake myself up, crying and shaking. I was so upset, in my half-wake state, that I decide to go back to sleep and have the dream again. I fell back asleep, and found myself driving my car to the bridge, just as before. But before I drive off the edge, I yank the steering wheel to the left, and avoid driving off the bridge. I pull the car to the side, and grab my baby out of his car seat and hold him tight, in his little blue, fuzzy snow suit. It is still dark, and cold, and I can see my breath. I am in the parking lot of Electric Park Ballroom--a venue that sits in the edge of the river. I am breathing fast and rocking back and forth. I saved the baby this time.

Rather than walking on a sidewalk with paved streets and light posts, I'm walking between unlit warehouses on either side of me. Then I'm suddenly inside a large building that's similar to an enclosed parking garage--that is, it's made of cement and has a low ceiling. Rather than cars, there are stacks of boxes and crates scattered around. When I see the shadows of two or more workers moving about, I believe it's dangerous, so I hide behind some boxes. Every once in a while, I can see a worker's face--a grotesque face one sees on Halloween masks, not the face of a human. I am very scared and try to sneak away without being discovered but someone--or something--dressed in dark clothes is following me. No matter which way I go, I can't find an exit nor shake whoever is behind me. Then I run inside a theater--I have no idea how I got there! All I know is the stage and seats are to my right, a wall to my left, stairs in front, and something awful chasing me from behind. So I run up the steps all the way to the top, but when I start to turn right and run between the row of seats, I stop and turn around to look at what's chasing me. Instead of a monster, it's an androgynous-looking human being who isn't frightening at all. The face appears to be similar to mine, is beautiful, and I'm no longer afraid. Though I can't articulate the experience, I sensed some truth about myself and/or life.\n",
